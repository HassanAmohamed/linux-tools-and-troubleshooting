Argument and Option Handling:

The script uses a while loop to parse command-line arguments. It checks for flags (-n, -v, --help) and assigns the pattern and filename to variables.
It validates input to ensure that a search string and filename are provided, and checks if the file exists.
Depending on the flags set, it either shows matching lines, line numbers, or non-matching lines.
Supporting Regex or Additional Options:

To support regex, I would modify the matching logic to utilize grep -P or similar functionality within the script. To add options like -i for case insensitivity or -c for count, I would need additional conditional checks in the argument parser to set corresponding flags and adjust the search logic accordingly.
Hardest Part to Implement:

The most challenging part was ensuring that the script correctly handles combinations of options, especially with the inversion of matches while maintaining the correct output format. Balancing the logic to handle different scenarios required careful testing to ensure accuracy in output.
